City of Two Domains — Cross-Platform MMO/IP Seeking Industry Collaboration

Project Introduction

City of Two Domains is a next-generation, fully cross-platform MMORPG, supporting true synchronization between PC and mobile devices. Players can switch between devices anytime, with all progress, characters, friends, social features, and trading seamlessly unified. The project centers on a player-driven economy, AI-powered equipment creation, dual-faction narrative, branching multi-ending storylines, and large-scale dynamic world events. The design supports future IP expansion including animation, comics, and esports.

The IP is officially registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. We are seeking publishers, investors, studios, and development partners for co-development, licensing, IP acquisition, or industry incubation.

Major Systems Overview

Career Tree & Progression

* Six Base Classes: Swordsman, Ranger, Mage, Pastoral, Artisan, Psychic

Story Branches & Multiple Endings

* Four Main Narrative Routes: Faction Loyalty, Espionage, Demon Symbiosis, World Integration
* Distinct Chapters and Multiple Endings: Each route features its own unique story arc and outcome (e.g., ultimate unification, total resistance, sacrifice, alienation).
* Player Agency: Major NPC fates, city control, and world ending are all influenced by player choices. Multiple playthroughs unlock all branches and hidden content.
